# Spaceship

## Why is it here?
This game project lacks the development since there are many tasks of the workflow in which my team didn't have
the ability to accomplish. You can use the project and keep working on it; the storyline is not complete.

## What has been done in my development process?
* The game environment is incomplete: only one stage is finished.

### Models
* Main Character
* Spaceship
* Bot

### Algorithm
* Player (Interaction and Health)
* Door
* Bot (Structure, Shooting, and Path Finding)

## Getting Started
